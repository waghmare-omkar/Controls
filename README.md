# Controls
This folder is a collection of frequently used and needed matlab programs in controls. Much of the code was developed by the author (Mr. Omkar Waghmare) during his time learning and developing controllers.Some of the files depend on some models or other mfiles but that is obvious and can easily be modified by other user. Specific areas have been masked in the code by the author where users can make changer to use this code for their purpose.
Here is a list of Codes present in the file and details about them:
1) eulerF.m  --> Applies Forward or Explicit euler method to integrate/discretize ODE equations.
2) spacecraft_attitude_dynamics.m --> Contains Spacecraft attitude dynamics 
3) double_intg_pid.m --> Dynamics and PID control of double integrator
4) sim_double_intg --> Simulate Double Integrator (Linked to 3)
