# Controls
This folder is a collection of frequently used and needed matlab programs in controls. Much of the code was developed by the author (Mr. Omkar P. Waghmare) during his time at University of Michigan Ann Arbor .Some of the files depend on some models or other mfiles but that is obvious and can easily be modified by other user. Specific areas have been masked in the code by the author where users can make changer to use this code for their purpose.
Here is a list of Codes present in the file and details about them:
1) eulerF.m  --> Applies Forward or Explicit euler method to integrate/discretize ODE equations.
2) spacecraft_attitude_dynamics.m --> Contains Spacecraft attitude dynamics 
3) double_intg_pid.m --> Dynamics and PID control of double integrator
4) sim_double_intg --> Simulate Double Integrator (Linked to 3)
5) Simulating_Vehicle_Cruise_Control.m --> Simulating Vehicle Cruise Control Dynamics
6) KF_application_to_Vehicle_Cruise_Control.m --> Kalman Filter Implementation to Cruise Control
7) Cruise_Control_Simulink --> Simulink Model with PID Controller of cruise control
8) Cruise_Control_Simulink_Data.mat --> Workspace Data for Cruise_Control_Simulink Code.
9) Lateral_Vehicle_Dynamics_Error_Model --> Lateral Vehicle Dynamics Model in Simulink --Error Formulation
10) Lateral_Vehicle_Dynamics_Error_Model_Parametrs --> Support file containing variables for lateral dynamics simulink model
